## Homework description: 

This past week we spent sometime working with virtual environments. Virtual environments refer to many
technologies but our focus was on the Python based "virtualenv". The creation of python based virtual 
environments allow you to install the various packages you need to complete the job and helps deal and
manage package dependencies and conflicts. This weeks homework assignment will help to demonstrate how 
this works and will help to increase your fluency with virtual environment concepts.


## Homework objectives:
  
1. Install or confirm the installation of a python based virtual environment.
   (For those of you using Anaconda refer to material specific to your implementation)
   
2. Confirm version of virtaulenv package.

3. Create virtual environment <venv-1>, activate, install flask

4. Create virtual environment <venv-2>, activate, install django

5. Create virtual environment <venv-3> installed w/ Python 2.7x , activate, install pandas

6. For each environment show the installed python packages

(hint: Becareful not to nest your environments)
